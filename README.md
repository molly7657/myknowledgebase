## ðŸ“š BetterPT Backend Project: PKB

### Overview

Your task is to work on the first iteration of a brand new, cleverly named app: PKB (Personal KnowledgeBase).

PKB is designed for software developers to keep track of resources that they accumulate throughout their days. There are two main types of resources that PKB should should keep track of:

1. PDFs
2. Articles - at a minimum, this consists of a URL.
   
   **Example**: [Monads, Haskell, and Elm: A Socratic Dialogue](http://bit.ly/2HPhRXi)

**NOTE:** *You do not have to create a frontend, you only need to create an API. If you prefer to create a frontend you certainly can.*

Because this is a **personal** knowledge base, a consumer of the API must be able to somehow be authenticated / authorized.

---

### Requirements

You are free to implement the API in anyway you see fit - besides the API specification below, there are only three requirements on the technology side (this would never happen in real life - enjoy it while it lasts!):

- The API must have at least one database.
- The API must be deployed somewhere.
- The authorization / authentication must be handled with JWTs. How you do this is up to you.

**How you structure your data models is entirely up to you.**

### API Specification

- As a consumer of the PKB API, I want to be able to upload PDFs in order to keep track of them.
- As a consumer of the PKB API, I want to be able to save Articles in order to keep track of them.
- As a consumer of the PKB API, I want to be able to search for PDFs and Articles.
- As a consumer of the PKB API, I want to be able to sort search results by date.
- As a consumer of the PKB API, I want to be able to downloads PDFs.

### Other Instructions

* Please try to submit the project by 17:00 on 09/15/2019 - if you need more time let us know.
* You should fork the repository, commit as you normally would and then put in a PR when you are ready.
* *Your project does not have to be perfect!* We're trying to get a feel for what you are capable of as a developer, your code organization, and solutions architecture skills.
* Feel free to reach out to Damian at any time (even if it is 4:00 am) if you have any questions - damian@betterpt.com.

Have fun!
